# EventGuestManager
Implemented a guests management system for events.

The program operates with two lists, one for the participants (with fixed capacity) and one waiting list.
Some of the functionalities include:
- adding or removing participants;
- searching for participans;
- updating details;
- automatically moving people from the waiting list to the participants list if spots become available;
- notifing participants of all the changes that occur.
